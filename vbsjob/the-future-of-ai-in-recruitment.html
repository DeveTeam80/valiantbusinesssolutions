                                          Before delving into the world of AI, it's essential to understand the traditional recruitment process. Historically, hiring new employees has been a time-consuming and often costly endeavor. It involves posting job openings, sifting through resumes and applications, conducting interviews, and, ultimately, selecting a candidate. The traditional process is manual, and it can be plagued by bias, inefficiencies, and subjectivity.

                                            AI is bringing about transformative changes in recruitment, and it's doing so across various stages of the process. Let's take a closer look at how AI is reshaping recruitment:<br><br>
